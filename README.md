NBA_AND_FATHER_TIME:

This is a sports analysis to determine whether age has an effect on diffrent shot percentages and offensive aspects to the game of basketball. If there is a correlation then it will help determine whether age carries a positive correlation or a negative correlation. Data was aquired from an online source that was a collection of 60 season with a wide variety of players over the course of those seasons.

Data from over 60 season was used, and filtered to only incorporate players who have played the average amount of career years which equal to 5-15 years. This was the average range of years that exclude true outliers like players who have played 1 or 20 years.

Data was read into R.

Initial exploration was conducted which proved there needed to be lower and upper parameters.

Data was read and subsetted to fit the range stated above. With creations of vectors that prove the subset was correctly done.

Scatter plots were created with ggplot with a regression line added to see if there is any slope along with some histograms and boxplots.

Data analysis was further conducted to see the correlation between the tested variables by looking at the R squared values and slopes.

There was very little correlation within some groups of variables and a lot in one group of variables. Most interesting positive correlation was between free throw % and age.
